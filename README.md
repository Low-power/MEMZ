# MEMZ
A trojan made for Danooct1's User Made Malware Series.

I am not responsible for any damage made using this trojan.

The build scripts are modified from original version to support original MinGW GCC and cross-building on non-Windows OS.

Building requirements:

 - GNU make;
 - sh-compatible shell (such as BASH);
 - Python 2.6+ with [Midi](https://github.com/vishnubob/python-midi) and [Pillow](https://github.com/python-pillow/Pillow) libraries;
 - NASM or compatible (such as YASM);
 - MinGW or MinGW-w64 GCC, binutils and Windows SDK targeting i\[3456\]86;
 - qemu-system-i386(1) (additional, if you want to test the payload).
